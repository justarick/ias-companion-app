# Icarus Adventure System Companion App - IASCA

This tool is a fan project based on the Icarus Adventure System by [Donnerhaus](https://donnerhaus.eu/).

Its purpose is to support DMs in sessions in mainly two points:
- carry out challenges
- keeping track of combat member stats during combat

I built this tool for myself but if you want to use it too you can visit the side [HERE](https://justarick.github.io/ias-companion-app/#/).

Have fun!
